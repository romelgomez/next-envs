# NextJS Environment Experiments

The intention is to have a more close to production template for NextJS that will work in any cloud provider with docker and not with Vercel, with Vercel is a breeze to have this setting but more expensive. The most affordable (at this commit) provider that I know is  is railway.app.

## So we have two experiments with railway.app: 

- [x] The first one is clone the project in railway.app, and define the env vars in the project variable interface.

  With the code already here this experiment works fine!


- [ ] The second one is clone the docker build from ghcr.io, a docker container registry.
  
  To-do: All the env var are undefined.
