# NextJS Environment Experiments

The intention is to have a more close to production template for NextJS that will work in any cloud provider with docker and not with Vercel, with Vercel is a breeze to have this setting but more expensive. The most cheap (at this commit) provider that I know is more affordable is railway.app.

## So we have two experiments with railway.app: 

- The first one is clone the project in railway.app, and define the env vars in the project variable interface.

- The second one is clone the docker build from ghcr.io, a docker container registry.
